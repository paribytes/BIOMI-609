	The three C's that we need to look at while looking at the generated assemblies are 1.) Correctness, 2.) Completeness, and 3.) Contiguity. N50/NG50 scores measure the contiguity. Here, the higher the N50 score, the better the assembly is. Out of the three assemblies generated through Velvet, SPAdes, and Unicycler, Unicycler is giving the highest N50 score. Unicycler assembly gives the lowest mismatches per 100 kbp as well. Looking at the contigs in stats without the reference genome, we can see that Unicycler assembly has the lowest contigs. However, the total length generated by SPAdes is closest to the reference genome.
