Assignment 3 - HIV Phylogeny 

Read this paper by Faria et al., 2014, where they utilize phylogenomics to understand the origins and spread of HIV-1. DOI: 10.1126/science.1256739 Links to an external site.. Now you will analyze data from this paper that Iâ€™ve uploaded as a multiple sequence alignment (assignment3.fas), which is the envelope protein, aligned from across 466 strains from across the world (a full list of accessions, and their origins and times of sampling are also uploaded to Canvas). Build another multiple sequence alignment using MAFFT by adding sequences to this alignment from other countries other than the ones in this study (you can do this by just using BLASTN, then downloading more samples that match back). Now use RAxML that we have discussed in lab (refer to Lab 3 Phylogenomics) to construct a phylogeny using the GTRGAMMA model. Interpret these results now - particularly tracking the origins of viral transmission. Please submit (a) the final phylogeny that you have estimated using RAxML (just the most likely one) as an image, (b) a text/Word file describing the results in the context of the Faria et al., 2014 study. 

I've also uploaded a file called "Assignment3_AccNos_Yrs_Loc.txt", which has a list of all accession ID's and details of where and when they were collected from the Faria et al., study, for your reference.
