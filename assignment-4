Assignment 4 - Population Genomics 

1. Write your own code to read a VCF file, and compute (a) heterozygosity, (b) allele frequencies at each locus, and output this into two separate files. Use the file provided (assignment4.vcf), and compute those statistics using your code, then submit the code, as well as the output files (20 points). Note that you can use Pysam’s VCF reading methods (https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#working-with-vcf-bcf-formatted-filesLinks to an external site.) to make your life a lot easier. There are similar readers in R as well (e.g. vcfR).
 

2. Read Beale et al. (2021): 10.1038/s41564-021-01000-zLinks to an external site. on the global evolution of Treponema pallidum. You will now utilize the variant file produced from this study (I’ve uploaded this to your Canvas page - assignment4.vcf). Use ADMIXTURE to estimate population structure from this dataset. Determine the optimal number of subpopulations using the cross validation error method, and plot your results. I have also uploaded a file called “assignment4_indivs”, which contains the ID’s of all the individual T. pallidum strains used in this study, along with an Excel file containing information about the geographic origins of these strains. Thereon, use R to determine the ancestries (for example, to determine which individuals belong predominantly to the first subpopulation, say you’ve read the ancestry file into R as: x<-read.table(“tp.3.Q”, header=FALSE), then you can use y<-which(x$V1>=0.9), which will give you the columns of individuals with predominantly ancestry from the first subpopulation, say you’ve read the indivs file into a variable called z, then you can just use z[y] which will give you all the individual strains in the first subpopulation. Now refer to the Excel file provided (assignment4.xlsx) to interpret the subpopulation structure within global strains of T. pallidum. Explain your answer with respect to the findings from the paper (10 points).
